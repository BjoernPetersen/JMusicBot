There are four base classes, which all implement the same basic Plugin contract: GenericPlugin PlaybackFactory Provider Suggester Lifecycle \u00b6 Plugins have a well defined lifecycle, and it is extremely important that you understand it in order to create your own implementation. PlaybackFactory \u00b6 A PlaybackFactory provides a way to actually play a specific kind of song, for example MP3 files or YouTube videos. A few restrictions are imposed on Playback factories: It must be possible to pause and resume playback It must be possible to abort playback prematurely The end of a song must be automatically detected and reported to the bot Note that it is not a requirement to keep track of the duration a song has played. Playback \u00b6 A PlaybackFactory creates a new Playback object for every song it should play. The Playback object is used to play a song exactly once. To implement Playback , you basically only need to implement two methods: play() and pause() . In addition to that, there is a waitForFinish() method that is supposed to block any callers until the song has finished playing. If you choose to extend the AbstractPlayback interface (recommended) you only don't have to implement the method, but only have to call the markDone() method once the song has finished. While this design has some limitations for the bot, it allows you to create implementations for a variety of services. For example, it wouldn't be possible to play Spotify songs if the only possibility were to directly stream songs, because Spotify doesn't allow that. Instead, the Spotify plugin simply controls the playback of an official Spotify client (which typically runs on the same machine as the bot).
