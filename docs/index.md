# Overview

MusicBot is a library that allows you to create a collaborative music queue using songs from
several providers like Spotify, YouTube or Google Play Music.

This site is still in an early stage and not comprehensive yet. Feel free to create a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/BjoernPetersen/JMusicBot/issues) if you have questions or
suggestions.
